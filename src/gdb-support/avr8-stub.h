 * avr8-stub.h

 *  Created on: 25. 3. 2015
 *      Author: Jan Dolinay
 *
 *  Header file for
 *  GDB Debugging Agent (GDB stub) for ATMega328
 * This code is actually "gdb stub" - code which runs in the debugged MCU and
 * communicates with the gdb debugger. It uses gdb RCP protocol.
 * The code needs to handle UART Receive interrupt and interrupt for simulating
 * software interrupt (EXT0).
 *
 * The following project were used (and combined) to create this stub:
 * 1) AVR-GDBServer (https://github.com/rouming/AVR-GDBServer)
 * 2) avr-stub from uOS - embedded operating system (https://code.google.com/p/uos-embedded/)
 * 3) AVR gdbstub (http://zevv.nl/play/code/avr-gdbstub/)
 *
 * The API is inspired by the GDB documentation for stubs: (quote)
 * The debugging stub for your architecture supplies these three subroutines:
 * set_debug_traps
 * This routine arranges for handle_exception to run when your program stops. You must call this subroutine explicitly in your program's startup code.
 * handle_exception
 * This is the central workhorse, but your program never calls it explicitly—the setup code arranges for handle_exception to run when a trap is triggered.
 * handle_exception takes control when your program stops during execution (for example, on a breakpoint), and mediates communications with gdb on the host machine. This is where the communications protocol is implemented; handle_exception acts as the gdb representative on the target machine. It begins by sending summary information on the state of your program, then continues to execute, retrieving and transmitting any information gdb needs, until you execute a gdb command that makes your program resume; at that point, handle_exception returns control to your own code on the target machine.
 * breakpoint
 * Use this auxiliary subroutine to make your program contain a breakpoint. Depending on the particular situation, this may be the only way for gdb to get control. For instance, if your target machine has some sort of interrupt button, you won't need to call this; pressing the interrupt button transfers control to handle_exception—in effect, to gdb. On some machines, simply receiving characters on the serial port may also trigger a trap; again, in that situation, you don't need to call breakpoint from your own program—simply running ‘target remote’ from the host gdb session gets control.
 * Call breakpoint if none of these is true, or if you simply want to make certain your program stops at a predetermined point for the start of your debugging session.
 * (end quote)
 *
 * Note about porting to other AVR MCUs:
 * You need to change:
 * 1) UART code in uart_init, putChar and getChar
 * 2) Code for software interrupt emulation in gdb_enable_swinterrupt and gdb_disable_swinterrupt

/** FLASH_BREAKPOINTS - NOT SUPPORTED FOR NOW!
 * Use breakpoints in flash memory (replacing original instruction with
 * breakpoint when set.
 * (-) This means flash is overwritten often during debug session.
 * (+) Debugged program runs at normal (full) speed between breakpoints.
 *
 *
 * RAM_BREAKPOINTS
 * Use breakpoints in RAM. On each instruction the PC register is compared with
 * breakpoint addresses and if any BP address is reached, the program is halted.
 * (+) No wear of flash memory
 * (-) Debugged program runs very slow - interrupt occurs after every instruction
 * 		and in the ISR there are perhaps 100 cycles needed to save and restore context.
 * 		How much the debugged program is affected depends also on design of the program,
 * 		for example blinking LED with delays based of poling timer value may be affected
 * 		little, while delays using busy loop will be much much longer than expected.
